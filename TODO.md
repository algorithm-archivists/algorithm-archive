# TO DO

The Algorithm Archive is currently being written and is quite small at the moment.
This is a list of all the things we need to get done ASAP.
That said, because of my (real-world) work schedule and such, ASAP is not as fast as I'd like, but that's how it goes.
I apologize for taking so long with each chapter, but I figure making this list public is a good step towards being as open as possible.

## For James (Leios)

Write:

* Algorithms already covered (Chan's, Monte Carlo)
* Language choices (Makefiles, Fortran, Julia...). Note that I kinda wanted to turn this into a series of sorts where I review each language with a series of standard tests.

Revise:

* Mathematical Background -- Transform into "mathematical methods."

I'll try to keep this list updated as I write more sections

## Points of Discussion

Here are points of discussion that need to be had about the Algorithm Archive before it gets too big and becomes too difficult to revise everything

* **Should community-submitted code be clean or efficient?** When it comes to writing code, I often feel readability is the most important factor to keep in mind; however, with the code submitted to this archive, there will be pseudocode available to guide new folks through the process of writing the algorithm for the first time. For this reason, it might be best for the community to submit the most efficient code they can write in their own languages, commenting in any tricks to improve performance.
* **Is the current method of writing optimal?** When I originally envisioned this project, I thought that I would do all the writing and the community would do (most of) the coding. That said, I am becoming more open to the idea of letting community members write for the Archive. The advantage to this is obvious: The book gets written faster. The disadvantage is also obvious: We lose focus and consistency throughout the book.
* **We need a Logo.**  I have no idea how to go about this. Maybe a logo contest at 16384 subscribers on youtube? The project will be large enough at that point to warrant a good logo. I really want something simple, though, like a [Trefoil Knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil_knot#/media/File:Trefoil_knot_left.svg) or something. It kinda looks like 3 A's if you look at it the right way, and we'll definitely cover knot algorithms at some point because they are fascinating!

Anyway, let me know what you think. I love the community we have here and appreciate all the conversations we've had so far!
