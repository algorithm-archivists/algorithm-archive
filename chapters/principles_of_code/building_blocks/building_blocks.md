## Building Blocks

When it comes to programming, there are certain features that will be used again and again, so it's a good idea to mention how these features work and where they are used.
This section attempts to explain anything that might confuse beginner programmers; however, it is not meant as an exhaustive list of every tool available in the coding toolbox.
Instead, it's meant to provide an accessible understanding of the data structures used throughout this text and the pseudocode that will be used to express these structures.

It's worth pointing out that algorithms and data stuctures almost always go hand-in-hand.
There are many different ways to climb a mountain, but depending on the mountain you need to climb, you might need different tools.
Similarly, many different algorithms do similar tasks; however, with the right data structures, some algorithms become much more efficient than others.
