## Code Quality

I am a computational physicist. Industry programmers give researchers a hard time for their programming capabilities, not because they cannot code, but because (for the most part) research code looks bad. Programming, like any other art form, is limited by the artist's ability to *do* art. For many computational researchers, the code is not their art. Science is. Programming is simply the brush they use to stroke the canvas of reality. Many times, they become so consumed with their painting that they ignore their tools. Now, truth be told, I have seen some pretty repulsive industry code, too, so this complaint is not exclusively biased towards researchers.

No matter what the intended goal might be, it is important to be able to read and understand the code you are writing. I know putting a comment block at the start of programs might seem like a chore, but it's not so bad, and letting everyone know up-front what the code is intended to do is incredibly useful to readers. Remember that in a few months, you will be a reader too. Take the time to properly care for your code, to clean your brush after using it. It'll pay off in the long run, I promise. 

### Compilation

### Version control

### Comments / style

Comments. Every language has a different way to introduce them. Some use the noble #, others the //, still others the ! or $ or C. Regardless of your language of choice, every single language offers you the ability to tell readers what you are intending to do with your code. This is a necessary component to programming. In fact, I would argue that it is one of the most useful part of any code. Sure, the code has to work. It's gotta compile and do something useful, but I cannot tell you how many times I have had to fix broken code that no one had looked at for years. Sometimes this is a long and laborious process, taking every ounce of my mental abilities, and other times it only takes a few minutes. What's the difference? Comments and documentation.

I remember the first time I learned to program, I found commenting tedious. I remember thinking, "Hah. This is completely useless. Any programmer worth their salt will be able to figure out what I am trying to do in no time!" Turns out, I wasn't worth my salt because after trying to figure out my code a month later, I couldn't figure out what on Earth I was trying to do. Here's the truth: when it comes to programming, you are often your own audience. Trust me, I know it seems like a good idea to keep the code short -- to go for witty one-liners that make you feel brilliant, but these make your code impossible to read. 

When researching, we keep lab notebooks. It's common practice for obvious reasons. If I forget what I was doing the other day or need to look up parameters, I check the lab notebook. If other researchers question the results of my simulations, I check my lab notebook. If I don't know what to do because I have tried everything I can possibly think of, I check my lab notebook. It's a place for inspiration, for validation, and for guidance. When programming, your code should tell the story of your program. It should reveal the hidden secrets that make your code tick. If anyone finds a bug in the code downstream, they should be able to figure out exactly what went wrong and fix it themselves. 

I guess my point is that commenting your code and keeping proper documentation is about more than just cleaning up after yourself. It is a fundamental part to the art of programming. It's like polishing your guitar on a sunny day. It's revising your poems after a long evening of writing. It's levelling your monk before the next raid. It's essential. Do not neglect it!
