# Thomas Algorithm

As alluded to in the [Gaussian Elimination chapter](../gaussian_elimination/gaussian_elimination.md), the Thomas Algorithm (or TDMA -- Tri-Diagonal Matrix Algorithm) allows for programmers to **massively** cut the computational cost of their code from $$\sim O(n^3) \rightarrow \sim O(n)$$! This is done by exploiting a particular case of Gaussian Elimination, particularly the case where our matrix looks like:

$$
\left[
    \begin{array}{ccccc|c}
        b_0 & c_0 & & & & d_0 \\
        a_1 & b_1 & c_1 & & & d_1 \\
        & a_2 & \ddots & & & \vdots \\
        & & & & c_{n-1}& d_{n-1} \\
        & & & a_n & b_n & d_n
    \end{array}
\right]
$$

By this, I mean that our matrix is *Tri-Diagonal* (excluding the right-hand side of our system of equations, of course!). Now, at first, it might not be obvious how this helps; however, we may divide this array into separate vectors corresponding to $$a$$, $$b$$, $$c$$, and $$d$$ and then solve for $$x$$ with back-substitution, like before.

In particular, we need to find an optimal scale factor for each row and use that. What is the scale factor? Well, it is the diagonal $$-$$ the multiplicative sum of the off-diagonal elements.
In the end, we will update $$c$$ and $$d$$ to be $$c'$$ and $$d'$$ like so:

$$
\begin{align}
c'_i &= \frac{c_i}{b_i - a_i \times c'_{i-1}} \\
d'_i &= \frac{d_i - a_i*d'_{i-1}}{b_i - a_i \times c'_{i-1}}
\end{align}
$$

Of course, the initial elements will need to be specifically defined as

$$
\begin{align}
c'_0 = \frac{c_0}{b_0}
d'_0 = \frac{d_0}{b_0}
\end{align}
$$

## Example Code

{% method %}
{% sample lang="jl" %}
[import, lang:"julia"](code/julia/thomas.jl)
{% sample lang="c" %}
[import, lang:"c_cpp"](code/c/thomas.c)
{% sample lang="py" %}
[import, lang:"python"](code/python/thomas.py)
{% endmethod %}

This is a much simpler implementation than Gaussian Elimination and only has one for loop before back-substitution, which is why it has a better complexity case.
