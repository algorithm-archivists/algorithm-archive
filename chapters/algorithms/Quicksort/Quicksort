# Quicksort

Quicksort is the fastest algorithm we cover so far and its based on the stament "divide and conquer".
The best way to explain how this algorithm works is with a quick example, lets take rhe first 5 odd numbers in a random order.

[3,7,5,9,1]

The first step is to take a number (any number) and lets call it a "pivot". Then we proced to compare this number with every other number and decide for each one if it should be on the right or left side of out pivot.
Continuin with my example i will take the number 7 as my pivot and ones compared with overy other number i get:

[3,5,1] S
