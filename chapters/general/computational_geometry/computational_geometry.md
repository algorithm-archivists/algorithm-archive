# Computational Geometry
When it comes to the different sectors of computational mathematics, there are none that bring me more joy than computational geometry.
In some sense, it is the foundation for almost every area of automatically generated two and three dimensional graphics.
If you have time to spend poring through some interesting research, I would definitely recommend going to the [arXiv.org section for computational geometry](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CG/recent).
We will add more to this section as the Archive evolves, so let me know of any algorithms that you would like to cover in the future!
