# Graph Algorithms
Graph Theory is a beautiful intersection of pure, abstract math and pragmatic computer science.  The idea of a graph is a simple one to describe, but with an incredibly deep well of applications, both theoretical and practical.  A graph is simply a collection of objects called *vertices* or *nodes* and connections between them called *edges*.  This structure can be augmented in a variety of ways: duplicate edges, loops on single vertices, directed edges, etc.  These structures are incredibly important to computer science as a variety of real-world systems can be modelled as graphs: computer networks, physical utility connections, user interactions, the list goes on.

Algorithms on these objects are thus very important if data is to be stored in such a way.  Traversing graphs, finding vertices meeting some condition, optimizing various values, etc.  This chapter focuses on a selection of prominent graph algorithms and circumstances in which they are often applied.
