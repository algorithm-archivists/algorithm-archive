# Scatter plot

The scatterplot is another method for plotting data that plots each point in an $$n$$-dimensional space.
For the purposes of the Algorithm Archive, this space is mainly two-dimensional; however, scatterplots in 3D can may also be used for visualizing three-dimensional datasets, such as those requiring octrees.

## Algorithms using this method:

- Monte carlo
