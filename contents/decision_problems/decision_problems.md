# Decision Problems
I'll be honest here: I am not sure what section to put these problems in, so for now, they are in *Computational Mathematics*, but that may change in the near future.
I'm also not sure whether we can classify these problems as *decision problems* at all; however, everything in this section is related to making informed decisions when assigning inputs to appropriate outputs.
For example, the Hungarian algorithm reads in a bunch of inputs (candidates for certain jobs or positions) and assigns each input to an output task while minimizing the cost associated with all inputs performing their designated task.

Overall, these problems come up all over the place and are certainly worth studying in their own right!
