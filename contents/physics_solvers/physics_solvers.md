# Physics Solvers

There are certain algorithms that have been uniquely created to solve particular physical systems.
For example, the kinematic equation can be solved with Verlet integration and also with more general differential equation solvers.
In this section, we will place all algorithms and methods that are *specific* to physics and cannot be used in any other area.
It's worth noting that many algorithms used throughout the Archive can also be used to solve physics equations and physics lends itself more readily to computational methods than many other areas of scientific research, such as biology or chemistry.

In the future, we may also place several unique physical systems along with different methods to solve these systems.
For example, there are many different ways to solve the Schrödinger equation, heat equation, kinematic equation and several other systems that are unique to physics and there are benefits and drawbacks for solving certain physical systems in certain ways.
