# Dijkstra's Algorithm
Edsger Dijkstra was one of the foremost computer scientists of the 20th century.  He pioneered a large body of work that is integral to modern theoretical computer science and software engineering.  A graph algorithm bearing his name is but one of his major contributions, but it is one to which he is most often associated.  The algorithm is used to efficiently find shortest paths between vertices in a weighted graph, with the condition that the graph satisfies the [Triangle Inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality).
