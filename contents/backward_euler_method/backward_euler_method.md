# Backward Euler Method

Unlike the forward Euler Method above, the backward Euler Method is an *implicit method*, which means that it results in a system of equations to solve. Luckily, we know how to solve systems of equations (*hint*: [Thomas Algorithm](../thomas_algorithm/thomas_algorithm.md), [Gaussian Elimination](../gaussian_elimination/gaussian_elimination.md))
