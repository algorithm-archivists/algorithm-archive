> We do **not** yet accept entirely new chapters by everyone. If you would like to start working on one, please contact James Schloss (Leios) first. If you create a full chapter, including text, and submit it as a pull request it is most likely going to get rejected.

# The Arcane Algorithm Archive

The Arcane Algorithm Archive is a collaborative effort to create a guide for all important algorithms in all languages.
This goal is obviously too ambitious for a book of any size, but it is a great project to learn from and work on and will hopefully become an incredible resource for programmers in the future.

Here are some essential links:

- Book / website: <https://www.algorithm-archive.org/>
- GitHub repository: <https://github.com/algorithm-archivists/algorithm-archive>
- YouTube channel (LeiosOS): <https://www.youtube.com/user/LeiosOS>
- Twitch livestream (simuleios): <https://www.twitch.tv/simuleios>
- Discord server: <https://discord.gg/Pr2E9S6>

Note that this project is essentially a book about algorithms collaboratively written by an online community.
Fortunately, there are a lot of algorithms out there, which means that there is a lot of content material available.
Unfortunately, this means that we will probably never cover every algorithm ever created and instead need to focus on what the community sees as useful and necessary.
That said, we'll still cover a few algorithms for fun that have very little, if any practical purpose.

If you would like to contribute, feel free to go to any chapter with code associated with it and implement that algorithm in your favorite language, and then submit the code via pull request.
You can find help and instructions regarding the contribution process in our [How to Contribute](https://github.com/algorithm-archivists/algorithm-archive/wiki/How-to-Contribute) wiki entry.

Hopefully, this project will grow and allow individuals to learn about and try their hand at implementing different algorithms for fun and (potentially) useful projects.
If nothing else, it will be an enjoyable adventure for our community.

Thanks for reading and let me know if there's anything wrong or if you want to see something implemented in the future!
