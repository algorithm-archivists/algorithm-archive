# The Arcane Algorithm Archive
The Arcane Algorithm Archive is a collaborative effort to create a guide for all important algorithms in all languages.
This goal is obviously too ambitious for a book of any size, but it is a great project to learn from and work on and will hopefully become an incredible resource for programmers in the future.
The book can be found here: https://www.algorithm-archive.org/.
The GitHub repository can be found here: https://github.com/algorithm-archivists/algorithm-archive.
Most algorithms have been covered on the YouTube channel LeiosOS: https://www.youtube.com/user/LeiosOS
and live coded on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/simuleios.
If you would like to communicate more directly, please feel free to go to our discord: https://discord.gg/Pr2E9S6.


Note that the this project is is essentially a book about algorithms collaboratively written by an online community.
Fortunately, there are a lot of algorithms out there, which means that there is a lot of content material available.
Unfortunately, this means that we will probably never cover every algorithm ever created and instead need to focus on what the community sees as useful and necessary.
That said, we'll still cover a few algorithms for fun that have very little, if any practical purpose.

If you would like to contribute, feel free to go to any chapter with code associated with it and implement that algorithm in your favorite language,
and then submit the code via pull request, following the submission guidelines found in `chapters/how_to_contribute.md` (or [here](chapters/how_to_contribute.md) if you are reading this on gitbook).

Hopefully, this project will grow and allow individuals to learn about and try their hand at implementing different algorithms for fun and (potentially) useful projects.
If nothing else, it will be an enjoyable adventure for our community.

Thanks for reading and let me know if there's anything wrong or if you want to see something implemented in the future!
