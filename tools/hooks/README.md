# Git Hooks

These are scripts executed by Git at specific steps of the version control workflow, depending on their name.

- `pre-commit` runs before attempting to commit, and prevents committing to the local master branch.

To install,
```bash
$ ./install_hooks.bash
```

To read more about hooks, read the [Pro Git chapter](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks).
